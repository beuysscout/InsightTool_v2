**Interviewer:** Thanks for joining us today, Sarah. Can you tell me about yourself and your online shopping habits?

**Sarah:** Sure! I'm Sarah Mitchell, I'm 28 and I work in marketing at Google in Sydney. I shop online probably 3-4 times a week, mostly on my phone.

**Interviewer:** How often do you shop on mobile specifically?

**Sarah:** Almost always on my phone. I'd say 90% of my purchases are mobile. I use the Amazon app a lot, and I also shop on ASOS and sometimes Nike's website.

**Interviewer:** Walk me through the last time you completed a purchase on your phone.

**Sarah:** So last week I was buying running shoes on Nike's website. I found the shoes pretty easily, added them to cart. But then checkout was painful. I had to re-enter my address because autofill didn't work, and the payment page reloaded twice. I almost gave up honestly.

**Interviewer:** What was the most frustrating part of that experience?

**Sarah:** Definitely the address form. The fields were tiny on my iPhone screen, and when I tapped the zip code field it scrolled the whole page up. I couldn't see what I was typing. My email is sarah.mitchell@gmail.com and I had to type that out too because autofill broke.

**Interviewer:** How did the payment step feel?

**Sarah:** Actually the payment was fine once I got there. I used Apple Pay which made it quick. It's everything before the payment that's the real problem. The forms, the scrolling, having to create an account.

**Interviewer:** What happened after you completed the purchase?

**Sarah:** I got a confirmation email pretty quickly which was nice. But the confirmation page on the site was weird — it just said "order confirmed" with no details. I had to check my email at sarah.mitchell@gmail.com to see what I actually ordered.

**Interviewer:** If you could change one thing about mobile checkout, what would it be?

**Sarah:** Just make the forms smarter. Auto-detect my city from my zip code 2000, remember my info, make the fields bigger. Don't make me type my full address on a tiny keyboard every single time. You can reach me at 0412-345-678 if you need any follow-up.
