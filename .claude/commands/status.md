Perform a full build status audit of InsightTool_v2. Do the following:

1. Read `projectplan.md` and identify all phases and their line items.
2. For each phase, check the codebase to determine which items are **complete**, **partial**, or **not started**.
3. Identify any **gaps** — features that are listed as done but have missing or incomplete implementation.
4. Summarise findings in a table with columns: Phase | Item | Status | Notes.
5. Recommend what to work on next based on the current state.

Be thorough — check both backend (`backend/app/`) and frontend (`frontend/src/`) for each item. $ARGUMENTS
